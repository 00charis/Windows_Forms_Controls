# Tutorial 2: Create a Timed Math Quiz
(Please refer to the Microsoft Docs website: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/tutorial-2-create-a-timed-math-quiz?view=vs-2015)

This is a step by step tutorial.

- Step 1: Create a Project and Add Labels to Your Form

Set the **AutoSize** property to True, which causes the button to automatically resize to fit the text.
- Step 2: Create a Random Addition Problem

The second statement sets the Enabled property of the startButton control to False so that the quiz taker can't choose the button during a quiz.
- Step 3: Add a Countdown Timer

Because the interval value is milliseconds, a value of 1000 causes the Tick event to fire every second.

The code editor appears and displays the method for the Tick event handler that you just added.

end here: Based on what you added
- Step 4: Add the CheckTheAnswer() Method
- Step 5: Add Enter Event Handlers for the NumericUpDown Controls
- Step 6: Add a Subtraction Problem
- Step 7: Add Multiplication and Division Problems
- Step 8: Customize the Quiz
